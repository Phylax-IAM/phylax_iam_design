# 🖥️ System Design: Phylax IAM

---

## 🎯 Overview

- Phylax is a secure, multi-tenant Identity and Access Management (IAM) system that provides authentication and authorization solutions, including OAuth2, API key support, Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA), RBAC, and ABAC. It can integrate seamlessly with any application or operate as a standalone service.
  
- Phylax addresses the complexities of managing secure, scalable authentication and authorization across multiple applications and tenants. It simplifies user access control, ensuring organizations can easily enforce security policies while maintaining flexibility and compliance with varying business needs.
  
- Phylax provides a unified IAM solution for managing users, roles, and permissions, with customizable security policies for multiple tenants. It offers centralized control over user access, authentication, and authorization, supporting both default and tenant-specific configurations.
